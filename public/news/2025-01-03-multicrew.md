Happy New Year to everybody

Behind the scenes, the DCS: OpenSource team, comprising of Caffeine Simulations, and a few other mod team members, have been working on multicrew sync functionality.

Todays update is more of a test demonstration rather than an actual progress update. At this stage we are not confirming multicrew sync as a feature that will be available, but we are working hard to make that be the case.
This is an important step for the T-38C, since being able to see what your student pilot is up to while flying, is a core component of the effectiveness of pilot training.

The multicrew video linked below consists of two halves, the first half consists of the front seater, in this case @BrianTheBrain using the avionics, and myself in the back seeing his changes real time. Then we swap to me in the back sending inputs. The sync is bidirectional at anytime, but for the simplicity of the video, we split it in half.
The two UFCPs in the Talon are seperate, however the values they control (such as radio frequencies etc) are the same. You will see this on display several times throughout the video

Also making its debut this update is the error messages that flash the incorrect input until you fix them.

See you in the next update
