Today we present our part 1 of our avionics overview.
This focuses on the UHF radio, various altitude settings, Mode 3 IFF, and ADSB callsigns.

The UFCP is functionally complete, just needing the last few pages. These will be built alongside their associated MFD pages and sub systems. These will be outlined in part 2 in a month or two. 

If after finishing the video the avionics seem complex, and hard to use you, don't worry, we will produce much more indepth tutorials. 

A special thanks to our SME team for taking some time to help verify some things the manuals aren't very clear on. This allows us to narrow it down and achieve a highly realistic simulation of the avionics

Any questions, as always, feel free to ask in ‚Å†t-38-discussion 

Thank you for your passion and support üòâ
