It's been a busy few weeks, reflected in the slightly larger gap between updates then we planned.

Work has been ongoing in the avionics, building out the core features of the Mission Display Processor (MDP) including core GPS navigation features such as waypoints, flight plans, and training zones. All of these now factor in DCS's unique "Flat earth" coordinate system, as well as conversion automatically into the T-38Cs two supported coordinate formats, MGRS and Lat/Lon.

These new features highlighted some core issues in the navigation MFD pages, prompting a rewrite of the code bringing performance optimizations, and more accurately placed icons and drawings on the MFD map. An additional byproduct of these changes is the ability to more dynamically use our Data Cartridge functionality, seen here.

On to todays video, Today we present the ZONE page, and Training zones drawn on the HSD/SIT pages. These drawings are able to be loaded from either the mission file, or externally via the Data Cartridge. These zones are fully customizable, and include custom names, shapes, positions, and default visibility.

The ZONE page allows either pilot or instructor to toggle the visibility of the training zones (shown in video) or edit the zones manually (not currently implemented)

This functionality represents a core part of our commitment to Milsim Squadrons looking for an advanced trainer to prepare them for their missions by building a capable, and customizable training environment. The included manual will ship with detailed instructions for including these features in your missions.

As always, Thank you for your kind words, and continued support of the project

See you in the next one
