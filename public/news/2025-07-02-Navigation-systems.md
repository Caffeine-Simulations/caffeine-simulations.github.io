We've been hard at work for the last few months, replicating the highly in-depth Navigation Systems of the T-38C Talon.  
This Includes:
* EGI (GPS) Navigation (waypoints and ICAO fixes)
* VORs
* TACANs

These systems are powered by our NavData Plugin, to simplify collecting and using the navigation information from each DCS Map. This plugin has been open sourced for the modding community to use! If you are interested, send me a PM on Discord or on the ED Forums.

As always, huge thank you to the SME team for this one (and blame them for the delay in posting this). With their help, many flaws have been corrected from colours to functionality.

Enjoy the video and see you in the next one!
