At long last we are proud to announce the completion of our front cockpit model.

This has been a 14 month long battle to achieve the highest level of detail possible (You can see how we started here ⁠t-38-progress-updates⁠). I'd like to thank @SHELTER OhOh for stepping up and taking over from me, and doing a spectacular job.

The model is made from over 100 high detailed photographs from both real jets and the simulators, a huge thanks to our resident Talon drivers for sourcing whatever we asked, and even a few airport staff snapping pictures of Talons when they come to visit.

2 months ago we were extremely fortunate to be given a 3D scan of the front cockpit to help verify the accuracy of our model, using this, we were able to bring the accuracy of our model down to a few millimeters, tweaking angles, sizes and positions, so our reproduction is faithful to the real thing.

Next up, then model will be UV unwrapped, then texturing will begin, and you will start seeing the new model appearing in our progress update videos.

Thanks for following along as we continue to push the boundaries of modding.

Cheers

Hayds
